2) If the code not execute properly, we have to install the required packages and change the token keys etc...
3) finally we got the out put, check whether the o/p is usefull to us.
4) we can see the out put means only one word display what we search, so search some words every time ?
    
	-> How can search some words means,Go through the search function there we can change string to array of strings.
	-> finally search the number of words or names by using "SEARCH" keyword at a time.
		for ex:-
		  words=['Koffee with Karan ','Nach Baliye','MTV Roadies','Dance India Dance ','Kaun Banega Crorepati']

5) Once again check whether the o/p is usefull or not,more over than it is not 
	use full because we can find number of un usefull single line statements and
	URLS repeted twitters names .

6) The main target is Rectifying the 'One line statements' and 'URLs'and repeted 'twits' before the program executes.
7) So rectifying operations is provided by the Twitter Developers its called"OPERATORS",
	those can rectify the one line statements and urls and repeted persons.

	for example:-
		    filter:links 		= containing "words" and linking to URL.
		    since:2010-12-27 	= containing "words" and sent since date "2010-12-27" (year-month-day).
			until:2010-12-27 	= containing "words" and sent before the date "2010-12-27"
            beer -root 			= containing "word" but not "words".

8) These operators are 15 types. we can use operators like these "words -RT -filter:links"
9) The default twits we can see 15 only, we have to change the count maximum is 100 twits.
10) There is no problem for language, write number of language words in one array.
